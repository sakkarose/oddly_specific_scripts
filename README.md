Personal scripts that I created for my personal uses

**Scripts List**

* **Offline_WU.ps1** - (**PowerShell**): Installs all offline Windows updates (.msu files) found in its own directory, ensuring it runs with administrator privileges. Error handling is not necessary since it won't take long before wusa knows this update is already installed or not elligible.
* **Microsoft-Edge_removal.ps1** - (**PowerShell**): This script thoroughly removes Microsoft Edge from Windows systems, including uninstalling all packages, deleting files and folders, clearing registry entries, and disabling scheduled tasks.
