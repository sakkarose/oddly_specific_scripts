Personal scripts that I created for my personal uses

* **Offline_WU.ps1** - (**PowerShell**): Installs all offline Windows updates (.msu files) found in its own directory, ensuring it runs with administrator privileges. Error handling is not necessary since it won't take long before wusa knows this update is already installed or not elligible.
